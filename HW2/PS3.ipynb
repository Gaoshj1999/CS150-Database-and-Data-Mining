    "In this problem we'll explore an optimization often referred to as **_double buffering_**, which we'll use to speed up the **external merge sort algorithm** we saw in _Lecture 12_.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although we haven't explicitly modeled it in many of our calculations so far, recall that _sequential IO_ (i.e. involving reading from / writing to consecutive pages) is generally much faster that _random access IO_ (any reading / writing that is not sequential). Additionally, on newer memory technologies like SSD reading data can be faster than writing data (if you want to read more about SSD access patterns look [here](http://codecapsule.com/2014/02/12/coding-for-ssds-part-5-access-patterns-and-system-optimizations/). \n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, for example, if we read 8 consecutive pages from file $A$, this should be much faster than reading 1 page from $A$, then 1 page from file $B$, then the next page from $A$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In this problem, we will begin to model this, by assuming that 8 sequential _READS_ are \"free\", i.e. the total cost of $8$ sequential reads is $1$ IO. We will also assume that the writes are always twice as expensive as a read. Sequential writes are never free, therefore the cost of $N$ writes is always $2N$.**\n",

    "* **ONE BUFFER PAGE RESERVED FOR OUTPUT:** Assume we use one page for output in a merge, e.g. a $B$-way merge would require $B+1$ buffer pages\n",
    "* **REMEMBER TO ROUND:** Take ceilings (i.e. rounding up to nearest integer values) into account in this problem for full credit!  Note that we have sometimes omitted these (for simplicity) in lecture.\n",

    "Recall that the LRU eviction policy removes the least recently used page when the buffer is full and a new page is referenced which is not there in buffer. The basic idea behind LRU is that you timestamp your buffer elements, and use the timestamps to decide when to evict elements. Doing so efficiently, requires some serious book-keeping, this is why in practice many buffer managers try to approximate LRU with other eviction policies that are easier to implement. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here we will focus on the _CLOCK_ or _Second Chance_ policy. In the CLOCK eviction policy, the candidate pages for removal are considered left-to-right in a circular manner(with wraparound), and a page that has been accessed between consecutive considerations will not be replaced. The page replaced is the one that - considered in a circular manner - has not been accessed since its last consideration.\n",
    "\n",
    "In more details the CLOCK policy proceeds maintains a circular list of pages in the buffer and uses an additional _clock (or second chance) bit_ for each page to track how often a page is accessed. The bit is set to 1 whenever a page is referenced. When clock needs to read in a new page in the buffer, it sweeps over existing pages in the buffer looking for one with second chance bit set to 0. It basically replaces pages that have not been referenced for one complete revolution of the clock. \n",
    "\n",
    "A high-level implementation of clock:\n",
    "1. Associate a \"second chance\" bit with each page in the buffer. Initialize all bits to ZERO (0).\n",
    "2. Each time a page is referenced in the buffer, set the \"second chance\" bit to ONE (1). this will give the page a second chance...\n",
    "3. A new page read into a buffer page has the second chance bit set to ZERO (0).\n",
    "4. When you need to find a page for removal, look in left-to-right in a circular manner(with wraparound) in the buffer pages:\n",
    "    - If the second chance bit is ONE, reset its second chance bit (to ZERO) and continue.\n",
    "    - If the second chance bit is ZERO, replace the page in the buffer.\n",

He wants to do this by being more of a sabermetrics guy than a numbers guy. As a first step in doing this he wants to find out which are the colleges each NFL teams prefers drafting players from. We have access to two tables: (i) a table named \"teams\" which contains (team, player) pairs, and (ii) a table named \"colleges\" which contains (player, college) pairs. Being all excited about databases you decide that there is no other way but to join the two tables and get the desired results. However, you have no access to a database.
